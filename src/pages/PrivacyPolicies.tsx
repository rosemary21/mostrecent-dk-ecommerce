        <p>
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is

          and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
          over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed
          to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
          cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
          to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
          modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
          personal information, transmission of personal information to and from
          our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services

        <h3>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
          uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
          signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
          inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
          notice.
